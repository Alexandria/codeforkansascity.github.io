Community Capital Fund requested that we build a map for their annual meeting. 
We delivered that and were able to load it up with about 90 projects at the firs
t meeting.
CodeForKC with Community Capital Fund has continued to enhance it on it over the past three years
moving it from a simple map to one that provides projects with a simple web presence.
