            <p>HackKC is still going on.  <a href="http://www.kcdigitaldrive.org/article/hacking-for-good-hackkc-advances-projects-for-a-digitally-empowered-community/">See what happend</a> June 6th and 7th.</p>

	    <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/kcbrigade/">Signup</a> and join us every monday night to continue work on our projects.</p>
	    
            <p>Part of the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, HackKC brings together
                urbanists, hackers,
                government staff, developers, designers, community organizers and regular people
                to collaborate in building new solutions using publicly-released data,
                open technology and design processes.</p>

            <p>Unlike traditional hackathons, Hack KC starts with a two-day event and continues into the fall as we will work together to bring projects to successful completion. Even after the hackathon is over, Code for KC will support your team and help you create a great civic project, from concept to beta.</p>
