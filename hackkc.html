            <h1 class="hack-details-blue"> What is Hack Kansas City?</h1>

            <p>A place for creating Civic Good by bringing together urbanists, hackers,
                government staff, developers, designers and community organizers
                to collaborate in building new solutions using publicly-released data,
                open technology and design processes.</p>

            <p>Frustrated with traditional hackathons? Hack KC starts with a two-day event, but we plan for projects to
                continue through the fall. Code for KC will support your team and help you create a great civic
                project.</p>

            <p>This is a part of <a herf="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a></p>

            <h1 class="hack-details-red"> Who should come?</h1>

            <p>Anyone can participate. You just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
                At the very least we need:
            <ul>
                <li> People with vision and passion</li>
                <li> People with expertise in all sorts of areas (see project ideas below)</li>
                <li> Usability designers and graphic designers</li>
                <li> Writers</li>
                <li> Coders and testers</li>
                <li> You!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h1 class="hack-details-blue"> What can I work on?</h1>

            <p>We have projects planned, but if you have an idea, let's hear it. Planned projects include:
            <ul>
                <li> Helping neighborhoods find and use the information they need. For example, what new businesses are
                    opening? What building demolitions are planned? What upcoming road projects will affect the
                    neighborhood? <a
