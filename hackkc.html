        <h2><em>What is Hack Kansas City?</em></h2>

        <p>On June 6, 2015, thousands of people from across the United States will come together for National Day of
            Civic Hacking. The Kansas City event will bring together urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers,
            designers, community organizers and anyone with the passion to make their city better. They will
            collaboratively build new solutions using publicly-released data, technology, and design processes to
            improve our communities and the governments that serve them. Anyone can participate; you donâ€™t have to be an
            expert in technology, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
        </p>
