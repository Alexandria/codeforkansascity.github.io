 This includes getting team members
re-engaged, getting your github repos and readmes cleaned up,

## Email

Email is a terrible, terrible collaboration medium, and an even
worse mechanism for storing organizational knowledge. There’s no
opt-in or opt-out mechanisms, no ability to link to or cross-reference
discussions, and conversation history lives in a teammate’s personal
inbox, so when they leave so too does the issue’s context. Use email
sparingly, and only when issues or chat, exposed to the company,
would be inappropriate for the conversation. Put another way, email
is for sensitive conversations.

## Hangouts and Face to Face

* Brainstorming
* Feedback
* Small talk and gossip

## Slack

* cordinating when working remotely 
* coordinating meetings time to do things
* annoucements
* discussion/sanity chek of ideas before they become issues or items on the Wiki

## GitHub Issues

Have a question? Open an issue. Have an idea? Open an issue. Notice
something’s a bit wonky? You guessed it, open an issue. Issues are
cheap. They cost seconds to create, and even if duplicative, are
closed just as easily. Issues start conversations, surface alternate
points of view, and most importantly, create permanent, searchable,
and linkable records of internal discussions, even if the answer
ultimately landed on is “wontfix”.

From http://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/

* Search before you open an issue
* Provide context
* Issues are constructive criticism
