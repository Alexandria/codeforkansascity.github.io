            <h2>CodeAcross, Feb 24, 2015.</h2>
            <p class="lead">First was the Civic Tech Forum, featuring 28 city council candidates
                sharing their views on technology's impact on the community. Then,
                we had a Civic Apps Showcase: 10 5-minute presentations from people
                who have built apps; a couple as part of the Brigade, but most from
                other sources: a big engineering firm, a couple of startups, two
                university projects, and a couple of passionate side projects. Good
                stuff, thought I'd share the videos:</p>
