# About CodeForKC

CodeForKC is a volunteer group that collaborates with the city government and
community partners to build new tools that help with local civic issues. CodeForKC
believes in public sector innovation (including civic-tech) and strongly supports
digital-government projects (especially involving open data, open source,
and open government). CodeForKC is a Code for America
Brigade Chapter.

Our volunteers consist of 550+ technologists, data scientists, community
advocates, designers, developers, journalists, educators, students, government
employees. In order to build an ecosystem that values free and open
technologies and processes, we emphasize diversity of thought and background
in our operations.
CodeForKC meets regularly each week to work on projects and brainstorm on current
civic issues and activities in the Kansas City area.

representatives from other brigades, and reporters covering issues in city
government.

## National Day of Civic Hacking (June 2016)

On June 4th, 2016, thousands of people in more than 106 communities across
the United States will come together to mark the fourth National Day of Civic

Hacking. This Code for America event, hosted in part by the White House,
encourages people to create apps and services using publicly-released data.
Together with local governments and community groups, they brainstorm,
design, prototype, and create solutions to improve our communities and the
governments that serve them.

Open to all students and professionals, NDoCH gives everyone the opportunity
to grow and learn – no matter your background or skill. Urbanists, civic hackers,
government staff, developers, designers, community organizers and civic
advocates have a role to play at our hackathons. The event aims to use the skills
of the city’s technology sector to improve residents’ quality of life, but anyone
can participate; you don’t have to be an expert in technology, you just have to
care about your neighborhood and community.

## Code Across (March 2017)

CodeAcross is a national weekend of simultaneous events in the Code for
America network of more than 40,000+ volunteers and more than 130+
brigades throughout the US. The goal of the CodeAcross event is to activate
the local civic technology network and collaborate with neighbors to develop
innovative solutions that help identify and solve real city challenges.
Open to all students and professionals, CodeAcross gives everyone the
opportunity to grow and learn – no matter their background or skill.
Urbanists, civic hackers, government staff, developers, designers, students,
community organizers and civic advocates all participate. CodeAcross isn’t
just a chance to build websites, visualizations, and other hacks; it’s also an
opportunity to build relationships within the community.

Desired Event Outcomes:

• Identify community concerns, examine issues, and prototype solutions
that help our communities and make the government more transparent
and more safe using public safety and health data

• Continue to power the narrative of Jersey City, the ‘Silicon Backyard’
being the leading modern city in New Jersey.

• Build lasting partnerships between the civic hacker community and
the Jersey City Government, City Council Members, Council
Nonprofit, Corporate and Educational Institutions
