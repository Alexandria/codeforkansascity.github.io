MAP to come.

# What is Hack Kansas City?

A place for creating Civic Good by bringing together urbanists, hackers,
government staff, developers, designers and community organizers
to collaborate in building new solutions using publicly-released data,
open technology and design processes.

Frustrated with traditional hackathons? Hack KC starts with a two-day event, but we plan for projects to continue through the fall.  Code for KC will support your team and help you create a great civic project.

This is a part of National Day of Civic Hacking

# Who should come?
Anyone can participate. You just have to care about your neighborhood and community. 
At the very least we need:
* People with vision and passion
* People with expertise in all sorts of areas (see project ideas below)
* Usability designers and graphic designers
* Writers
* Coders and testers
* You!

# What can I work on?
We have projects planned, but if you have an idea, let's hear it. Planned projects include: 
* Helping neighborhoods find and use the information they need. For example, what new businesses are opening? What building      demolitions are planned? What upcoming road projects will affect the neighborhood?  Read more >>
* Transportation solutions for bus and streetcar riders, cyclists and pedestrians.  Read more >>
* Raising awareness about historic places we are losing in KC.  Read more >>
* Mapping good things in KC such as STEM projects, where to get flu shots, where to get your taxes done, and much more.  Read more >>

# How do I get involved?
 
1. First. sign up. It is freeeeee!
2. Check out the ideas we have, or come up with some of your own.
3. Submit a project, or connect to an existing project.

We are in the process of forming teams now, and also have some ideas
that need leaders.  See the ideas, projects, and teams at our HackPad
Hack KC 2015 National Day of Civic Hacking

In the next two weeks we will start scheduling team meetings (either in person, by phone or online).  This way we
can make sure each team has what it needs on the day of Hack KC.

# What will I get out of it?

You'll work on solving local problems with your ideas. Do you think that one of your
idea can change your town or have a positive impact in your group
of people? Bring your idea notebook with you and start making a
positive change in your local community.

creative juices flow, HACK KC are perfect opportunities to work on
a new platform, learn a new programming language, or give marketing
a try.  With nothing to lose thereâ€™s no reason not to step outside
your comfort zone.

You'll have fun. During the weekend working alongside awesome people who
share your ideas. HACK KC is meant to be fun and entertaining so
enjoy it.

# Do I need to live in KC?
