            <p>We have a few projects planned, but need your ideas, too! We have already engaged Historic Kansas City,
                the City of KCMO, Community Capital Fund and others willing to support our projects. We just need
                designers, organizers, doers, and coders
                like you to lend a hand and a day or two to bring these ideas (and others) to life!

                Here are some examples of apps we can build together:</p>

                <dt> Neighborhood Dashboard</dt>
                <dd> Help develop a dashboard and map for neighborhoods that aggregates existing data and information
                    into a single,
                    easy-to-read site.
                    This may also have features to create monthly reports of activities in a particular neighborhood.
                    For example,
                    what businesses are opening or closing?
                    What opportunities are there for redevelopment, what Land Bank properties are available.
                    What upcoming construction projects/demolitions will affect the neighborhood?
                    Are there zoning and code changes that would effect your neighborhood?
                    Is your street going to be closed for repairs?
                    We’d like to build on the work Code for KC has done with the <a href="http://communitykc.org/">CommunityKC
                        map</a> for neighborhoods and nonprofits
                    to provide even more resources for those working to improve our neighborhoods and quality of life.

                <dt>Historic Survey to Save the City...a Planning Necessity</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Historic buildings provide a sense of place and continuity within
                        our city, but did you know that a an overwhelming amount of
                        neighborhoods and buildings have not been surveyed? Historic survey
                        and planning go hand in hand.
                        Within the planning process survey is a key component.
                        It helps the planner understand the neighborhood,
                        city and history they are working in.
                        It helps the city identify those places that make a city great and
                        also define those areas that may need help.
                        Data gathered in the survey drives future policy decisions,
                        defining what areas will be considered historic districts and
                        potential drive development financial incentives. Survey matters.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project will use an Architectural/Historic Inventory Form
                        (as found on the state of Missouri’s State Historic Preservation
                        Office’s website) to create an online application for iPad/iphone/tablet.
                        The goal of the project is to educate on proper survey guidelines,
                        create ease of access for preservation consultants and planners,
                        in addition to integrating the required property data that is
                        available from city and county resources.
                        A broader project goal is to be able to manipulate the data in order to create maps
                        within
                        GIS (or customizable GoogleMaps) in order to show ownership, or
                        property information based on survey data fields. </p>

                <dt>SafeAssist</dt>
                <dd>SafeAssist is a collaborative effort initiated by the Kansas City Police Department to provide
                    officers
                    with information that can aid them in more effectively managing contacts with diminished capacity
                    persons.
                    Every year the Kansas City Police Department contacts hundreds of individuals with physical and
                    behavioral health issues. Officers are often at a disadvantage in handling these types of service
                    calls
                    due to lack of information or communication impediments. SafeAssist was created to provide a vehicle
                    for
                    caregivers and individuals to share pertinent health and behavioral information to help both
                    officers and
                    individuals process the needs of those service calls much more effectively,
                    while increasing the overall quality of service.

                    We have recently (May 2015) engaged the Kansas City Design Center for assistance in developing an
                    implementation plan
                    for the next 2 years.
                    We are also investigating the possibility of the KCDC students designing alternative tree wells that
                    may include
                    stormwater capture elements.

                <dt>Partnering Blood Donation Centers, Labs, and Health Clinics</dt>
                <dd>
                    The blood supply at blood banks is often below optimal levels.
                    Moreover, ability to create and maintain a personal health record
                    may also be compromised among these groups.
                    A relationship between blood donation centers, labs, safety net
                    clinics, and hospitals could potentially improve upon both situations.
                    Current standards dictate that when a consumer enters a blood
                    donation center, if eligible, a donation is drawn and within 24-hours,
                    a dozen tests are performed on the donated blood – to establish the
                    blood type and test for infectious diseases (including HIV, Hepatitis,
                    STDs, and local parasites and viruses).
                    If a test result is positive, the donor is notified.
                    It should be possible to partner with blood donation centers and
                    labs to create a QR code associated with each donor’s unique blood
                    specimen identifier and retrievable through a smart phone or clinic
                    computer. The donor could be sent a link to download a QR code
                    with their health information including that gleaned from the
                    donation center’s self-report form and mini-physical as well as
                    their blood type and status on the other lab-run blood tests.
                    Any pathological findings could be red flagged and the client
                    directed to a specialist, if needed, without requiring a visit to
                    the safety net clinic.
                    With permission from the consumer and a clearance code from the lab
                    to unlock patient data (which could be automatically generated by
                    the lab upon entrance of clinic or hospital credentials or access
                    code), a clinic or hospital could access the QR code and easily
                    retrieve the consumer’s information before, during, and after a
                    visit in an effort to update and maintain the consumer’s records.
                    The consumer would also be able to share the code when visiting a
                    safety net clinic.

                <dd>P.A.T. is designed to allow those with an interest in
                    real estate to quickly assess if a piece of land is suitable for their project. The P.A.T.'s GIS
                    system allows users to pinpoint locations, access the current zoning information for the space, then
                    perform calculations to determine the specifications of an appropriate building.
