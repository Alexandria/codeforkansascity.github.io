            <p>We have a few projects planned, but need your ideas, too! We have already engaged Historic Kansas City,
                the City of KCMO, Community Capital Fund and others willing to support our projects. We just need
                designers, organizers, doers, and coders
                like you to lend a hand and a day or two to bring these ideas (and others) to life!

                Here are some examples of apps we can build together:</p>

                <dd>Build an app to help neighborhood leaders and members to use
                    information to keep everyone aware of changes and to solve problems.
                    For example,
                    what businesses are opening or closing?
                    What opportunities are there for redevelopment, what Land Bank properties are available.
                    What upcoming construction projects/demolitions will affect the neighborhood?
                    Are there zoning and code changes that would effect your neighborhood?
                    Is your street going to be closed for repairs?
                    We’d like to build on the work Code for KC has done with the <a href="http://communitykc.org/">CommunityKC map</a> for neighborhoods and nonprofits
                    to provide even more resources for those working to improve our neighborhoods and quality of life.

Wouldn't it be great if you could use your smartphone to quickly access information customized to your current location.? Let's improve commuter education while promoting digital information usage.

                    that anyone can contribute to or edit.

                <dt>Zoning - Parcel Assessment Tool</dt>
                <dd>P.A.T. is designed to allow those with an interest in
                    real estate to quickly assess if a piece of land is suitable for their project. The P.A.T.'s GIS
                    system allows users to pinpoint locations, access the current zoning information for the space, then
                    perform calculations to determine the specifications of an appropriate building.
