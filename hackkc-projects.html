            <p>We have a few projects planned, but need your ideas, too! We have already engaged Historic Kansas City,
                the City of KCMO, Community Capital Fund and others willing to support our projects. We just need
                designers, organizers, doers, and coders
                like you to lend a hand and a day or two to bring these ideas (and others) to life!

                Here are some examples of apps we can build together:</p>

                <dt> Neighborhood Dashboard</dt>
                <dd> Help develop a dashboard and map for neighborhoods that aggregates existing data and information into a single, 
			easy-to-read site. 
			This may also have features to create monthly reports of activities in a particular neighborhood.
                    For example,
                    what businesses are opening or closing?
                    What opportunities are there for redevelopment, what Land Bank properties are available.
                    What upcoming construction projects/demolitions will affect the neighborhood?
                    Are there zoning and code changes that would effect your neighborhood?
                    Is your street going to be closed for repairs?
                    We’d like to build on the work Code for KC has done with the <a href="http://communitykc.org/">CommunityKC map</a> for neighborhoods and nonprofits
                    to provide even more resources for those working to improve our neighborhoods and quality of life.

                <dt>SafeAssist</dt>
                <dd>SafeAssist is a collaborative effort initiated by the Kansas City Police Department to provide officers 
                with information that can aid them in more effectively managing contacts with diminished capacity persons. 
                Every year the Kansas City Police Department contacts hundreds of individuals with physical and 
                behavioral health issues. Officers are often at a disadvantage in handling these types of service calls 
                due to lack of information or communication impediments. SafeAssist was created to provide a vehicle for 
                caregivers and individuals to share pertinent  health and behavioral information to help both officers and 
                individuals process the needs of those service calls much more effectively, 
                while increasing the overall quality of service.

                <dt>Parcel Assessment Tool</dt>
                <dd>P.A.T. is designed to allow those with an interest in
                    real estate to quickly assess if a piece of land is suitable for their project. The P.A.T.'s GIS
                    system allows users to pinpoint locations, access the current zoning information for the space, then
                    perform calculations to determine the specifications of an appropriate building.
