            <p>We have a few projects planned, but need your ideas, too! We have already engaged Historic Kansas City,
                the City of KCMO, Community Capital Fund and others willing to support our projects. We just need coders
                like you to lend a hand and a day or two to bring these ideas (and others) to life!

                Here are some examples of apps we can build together:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt> N-Hood</dt>
                <dd>Build an app to help neighborhood leaders and members to use
                    information to keep everyone aware of changes and to solve problems. For example, what businesses
                    are
                    opening or closing? What building demolitions are planned? What upcoming construction projects will
                    affect the neighborhood? Is your street going to be closed for repairs?

                <dd>Variety of ideas for mapping tools, such as where to see STEM projects, get flu shots, where to get
                    your taxes done, and much,
                    much more. <a

                <dt>Zoning - Parcel Assessment Tool</dt>
                <dd>P.A.T. is designed to allow those with an interest in
                    real estate to quickly assess if a piece of land is suitable for their project. The P.A.T.'s GIS
                    system allows users to pinpoint locations, access the current zoning information for the space, then
                    perform calculations to determine the specifications of an appropriate building.

                    advance business,
                    law and civic use around this technology.
                    This is similar to logging into OReilly Books with your Google account, with more functionality.

                <dd>Lots of information is available, but sometimes you want data that isn't easily found. This project
                    will create a form and method to submit requests for specific data from the city??
