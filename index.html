        <h1>Who We Are</h1>

        <p class="lead">We’re Kansas City’s chapter of the Code for America Brigade network, a group of civic-minded
            geeks who volunteer our talents to projects that improve how our local governments and community
            organizations use the web. We strive for principles of open data and technology advocacy for civic good and
            are supported by our host organization, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kcdigitaldrive.org/">KC Digital
                Drive</a>. The
            Brigade is about action, so join us at a Hack
            Night where we’ll commit code to make a difference in our city!</p>

            we hear progress reports from teams who participated in HackKC: The National Day of Civic Hacking hackathon
            this past June.</p>

        <p>We'll also welcome people from the community with ideas for technology projects to come pitch their

        <h2>Meet the Teams</h2>

        <p>Since the HackKC hackathon in June, six teams have been working hard at our weekly Hack Night to develop apps
            that citizens of Kansas City will use to enhance the way they interact with their local government and
            communities around them. These teams include:</p>

        <p><b>N-hood Dashboard:</b> working to help neighborhoods help themselves by giving them easy access to useful
            data to allow them to identify and track problem areas in their neighborhood. Primary language: Ruby on Rails</p>

        <p><b>Parcel Assessment Tool:</b> a tool that can be used to create more transparency in land ownership, zoning
            and entitlements for specified sites.</p>

        <p><b>Storefront Street Tree:</b> allowing business owners to more easily plant trees in treewells outside their
            businesses.</p>

        <p><b>SafeAssist:</b> Emergency response app for police and other first responders to access info about the
            scene of an emergency before they arrive. Primary language: PHP/Laravel</p>

        <p><b>CommunityKC:</b> Visualization and management tool for community-based projects.  Primary language: PHP/Drupal</p>

        <p><b>People Hub:</b> Gamified app to acknowledge and to reward brigade member contributions, to keep everyone
            in the loop, to encourage team collaboration. Primary language: JavaScript/HTML/CSS</p>
