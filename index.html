        <h1>Who We Are</h1>

        <p class="lead">We’re Kansas City’s chapter of the Code for America Brigade network, a group of civic-minded
            geeks who volunteer our talents to projects that improve how our local governments and community
            organizations use the web. We strive for principles of open data and technology advocacy for civic good and
            are supported by our host organization, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kcdigitaldrive.org/">KC Digital
                Drive</a>. The
            Brigade is about action, so join us at a Hack
            Night where we’ll commit code to make a difference in our city!</p>

        <h2>Meet the Teams</h2>
 
        <p class="lead">Since the HackKC hackathon in June, six teams have been working hard at our weekly Hack Night to develop apps
            that citizens of Kansas City will use to enhance the way they interact with their local government and
            communities around them. These teams include:</p>

            for caregivers and individuals to share pertinent health and behavioral information to help first responders

            quality of service. Primary language: PHP/Laravel, <a

            parcels in their neighborhoods.
