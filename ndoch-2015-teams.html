        <h1>Ideas/Inspiration</h1>

            city.

        <h2>Tear Down Tattler</h2>

        <p>TearDown Tattler is envisioned to be a Early Warning System to let people know when a property is endangered
            of being demolished as early as possible. The earlier people know about a endangered building the easier it
            is to come to a consensus as to whether it should be demolished or not.</p>

        <h2>Transportation Project</h2>
