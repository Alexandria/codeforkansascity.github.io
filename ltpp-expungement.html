<h1>ClearMyRecord Expungement Project</h1>

<h2>University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law<br />
    Law, Technology, and Public Policy (LTPP) Lab Course</h2>

<p>In collaboration with UMKC School of Law, Code for Kansas City, and
    community stakeholders, the ClearMyRecord Expungement Project seeks
    to examine the process for expunging criminal offenses in Missouri
    under a new statute effective in 2018 and begin work toward developing
    technology that can assist underserved individuals to effectively
    seek and obtain expungement of minor convictions that impair their
    ability to live effectively in society.</p>

<p>Using a design-thinking approach, team members are collecting
    information about low and modest means expungement-seekers to develop
    interactive interview technology that will generate the forms
    necessary to file in court. Volunteer lawyers, working with
    expungement-seekers, tested an excel-based minimum viable product
    prototype at an Expungement Day at UMKC, and the team is using
    feedback received to improve the prototype. We will continue the
    feedback and iteration cycle, and can use software developers,
    designers and coders in this process and in the eventual development
    of a fully usable tool.</p>
